## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Backend:**

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 13+

**Frontend:**

- Node.js 16+ and npm 8+

**External Services:**

- Gmail account (for email verification)

- GitHub OAuth2 credentials (optional)

### Installation

#### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhihari010/AppTracker.git
   cd AppTracker/backend
   ```

2. Create PostgreSQL database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE apptracker;
```

3. Set environment variables (create `backend/env-dev.ps1`):

```powershell
$env:DATABASE_URL = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/apptracker"
$env:DATABASE_USER = "postgres"
$env:DATABASE_PASSWORD = "your_password"
$env:JWT_SECRET = "your-secret-key-min-32-characters"
$env:R2_ACCOUNT_ID = "your-account-id"
$env:R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "your-access-key"
$env:R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "your-secret-key"
$env:R2_BUCKET = "apptracker"
$env:R2_ENDPOINT = "https://<your-account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
$env:MAIL_HOST = "smtp.gmail.com"
$env:MAIL_PORT = "587"
$env:MAIL_USER = "your-email@gmail.com"
$env:MAIL_PASSWORD = "your-app-password"
$env:GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = "your-google-client-id"
$env:GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = "your-google-client-secret"
```

4. Run backend:

```powershell
cd backend
./env-dev.ps1
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Backend will start on http://localhost:8080

#### Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Create `.env` file:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

3. Run frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend will start on http://localhost:5173
